# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# In[3]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.

result = (3 * 4) + 5
print(result)


# In[2]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)


# **Objectives:**
# 
# - List popular languages for Data Science
# - Introduce common libraries used in Data Science
# - Explore data science tools and ecosystems
# - Practice evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# - Demonstrate conversion of units (e.g., minutes to hours) in Python
